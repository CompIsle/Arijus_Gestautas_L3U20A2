        <h3>Evaluation of Assignment One Web Page:</h3>
        <p>There are many ways in which the website could be improved, some improvements could include adding more
            user interactivity to the web page. The website could appear less cluttered if I added a few dropdowns or buttons to reveal content on many of the
            sub-headings, I would think that could potentially make it appear friendlier.
            <br>
            <br>Instead of adding static images, I could've considered adding examples of each of them with a pop-out which displays the code snippet, or for all of the pictures a carousel 
            would've appeared much nicer, possibly add a border around the picture whenever a person hovers over it would enlarge or pop out.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the box model page, it would be rather handy to display the actual Box Model on the page itself and point out what every specific bit appears as, possibly adding an option which
            would enable you to hover over the parts which act as a "Margin, Border, Padding or Content", this could be good practise to see the change once you make one of the parts 
            bigger or smaller, then you'd notice which parts change is shape.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another improvement which could reduce the clutter in my webpage would be on the Home page, scrolling down to the bottom of the page there's an Advantage and a Disadvantage list, possibly
            by adding all of this information in a table or making a button to reveal only the Advantages of a specific implementation style, or the other way around would reveal only the Disadvantages.
