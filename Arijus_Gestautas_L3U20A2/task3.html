<h3>What is a Browser Engine?</h3>
<p>A browser engine can be presented as the most important part needed in order for a browser to function properly, it helps to present the content of the web pages you see today after you
locate the URL you wish to visit. 
<br>
It gets its way around by understanding the HTML, CSS and JavaScript which is written on your web page, that way it allows it to function as it should if the code presented is bug free.
Though not all browsers use the same engine as any other browser because each engine is specifically designed for a different browser. Which is the case why each browser has its own way of understanding on how to interpret inside the web.
<br>
<br>
One of the main reasons why a scripting engine has to be relatively fast is because of the websites weight, the website could be filled with videos, user interactive features such as pop ups and moving objects, adverts and others.
The importance of having fast speeds when a website is loading because of the user importance, if the browser engine is slow it could cause major issues towards users which tend to use the internet for their daily use.
